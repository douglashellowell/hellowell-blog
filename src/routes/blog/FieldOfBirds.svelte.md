# a field of birds

I had the flu when this was recorded so my voice is not 100%

```
A little bird
Came right up to me
Found a thread, oh
Hanging from my sleeve

Then he flew up high
Until I fell apart
Stitches, they all flew, oh
From what hid my heart

So then a little girl
Came and found my bones
She built a man, oh
She should have made him watch

As the meadowlark
Found that needle's eye
As he made that patch, oh
For my broken sky

And so the winter night
Came down to our hands
Trying to steal, oh
What could soothe a man

Yes and still I knew
That old dark was mine
And it's fading out, oh
Every star I find

And so... By the day
Little girl and I
Shook all trees, oh
To see what would fly

And it's times like these
There's no need for words
I just need to find, ohhhhh...
I need a field of birds
```
